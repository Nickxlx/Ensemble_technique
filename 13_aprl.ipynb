    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-->A Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is widely used for classification tasks. This combine the prediction of mulitiple decision trees to make more accurate and robust predictions.

    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by using an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of data and features, which prevents individual trees from memorizing noise in the training data. This ensemble approach averages out predictions, leading to a more balanced and generalized model."

    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average of the individual tree predictions. In other words, for a regression task, the final prediction made by the Random Forest Regressor is the mean of the predictions made by all the individual decision trees in the ensemble. This aggregation method helps reduce the impact of noise and outliers present in the individual tree predictions, leading to a more stable and accurate overall prediction."

    "1. **n_estimators**: The number of decision trees in the forest.\n",
    "2. **max_depth**: The maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "3. **min_samples_split**: The minimum number of samples required to split a node.\n",
    "4. **min_samples_leaf**: The minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node.\n",
    "5. **max_features**: The maximum number of features to consider when making a split.\n",
    "6. **bootstrap**: Whether or not to use bootstrap samples when building trees.\n",
    "7. **random_state**: A seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility.\n",

    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-->  Both Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are used for regression tasks, Random Forest reduces overfitting by combining predictions from multiple random decision trees, whereas a single Decision Tree Regressor can be prone to overfitting because it can create complex models that fit the training data too closely."

    "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Predictive Accuracy**: Random Forest Regressor often produces highly accurate predictions due to its ensemble nature and ability to handle complex relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced Overfitting**: It mitigates overfitting by averaging predictions from multiple decision trees, making it more robust against noise and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Importance**: Random Forest provides a measure of feature importance, helping identify which features are most relevant for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Out-of-Bag Evaluation**: It includes an out-of-bag (OOB) estimation for assessing model performance without the need for a separate validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Robustness**: It is robust to missing values and can handle both categorical and numerical features without extensive preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: Random Forest models can be computationally expensive and require more memory, especially when the number of trees and features is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Less Interpretability**: While it provides feature importance scores, the ensemble's complexity can make it less interpretable than a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuning Random Forest hyperparameters can be challenging and time-consuming due to the number of options available.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Not Ideal for Linear Relationships**: Random Forest may not be the best choice for problems where relationships are predominantly linear, as it excels in capturing non-linear patterns."
